# Product-counter-circuit
#Using an LM358 can build a sensor unit with an infrared LED and a
photodiode. At the same time, the IC NE555 is used to generate
pulses, which are then fed into the 74LS90 counter to count the
pulses and trigger the 74LS47 to convert BCD to a 7-segment LED
display to show the results.
